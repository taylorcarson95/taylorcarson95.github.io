			<h1>It’s Time to Fix the Mortgage Interest Deduction</h1>
			<h2>As it currently stands, the Mortgage Interest Deduction doesn’t even make sense in Pennsylvania – or any other state, for that matter.</h2>

			<p>
				Appropriate tax reform is a highly debated topic – particularly this year, where reform is not just possible, but also extremely likely. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An often overlooked topic in the political world is tax reform in the housing market, where there is a growing lack of resources to make housing affordable for lower- and middle-income families. This is where reform needs to happen first, and it needs to start with the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID). 
			</p>
			<p>
				The MID is an itemized deduction. It’s offered as an incentive to eligible homeowners, because it allows them to deduct the interest they pay on any residential loan. As it currently stands, the MID has a $1 million cap on the amount of mortgage from which homeowners can deduct interest. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Both experts and everyday citizens across socioeconomic spectrums agree that, as is, this thing just isn’t working – and here’s why: the MID disproportionately benefits higher-income households, and almost excludes most lower- and middle-income households altogether. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It makes sense. Higher-income households are more likely to itemize their taxes. They also assumably have larger mortgages, which leads to larger deductions on their interest payments. This is a major problem, as the people who are most likely to need financial assistance (lower- and middle-income households) miss out on the tax break altogether, while the people who get the tax break (higher-income households) don’t really need it. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE</h4>
			<p>
				The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) [LINK] relaunched its United for Homes campaign [LINK] on a mission to rebalance the MID. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The campaign proposes to modify two crucial aspects of the MID as it currently stands: that ridiculously high $1 million cap on mortgages eligible for a tax break, and the deduction itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first modification would lower the cap from $1 million to $500,000. According to Diane Yentel, president and CEO of NLIHC, this would impact fewer than 6 percent of mortgage holders nationwide, mostly in New York and California.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second modification calls for changing the deduction into a 15 percent non-refundable tax credit, which would benefit 15 million more homeowners who don’t make enough to itemize, and thus, are unable to receive any tax benefit. 
			</p>

			<h4>THE NUMBERS IN PENNSYLVANIA</h4>
			<p>
				Even from a logical standpoint, it’s evident that the MID needs to change. Throw in some statistics, and you’ll be even more sure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s look at the numbers for our region. In Philadelphia County, between 1.1 and 3 percent of mortgages exceeded $500,000. That’s right, less than 5 percent of our county’s population is influencing our housing market. 
			</p>

			</div>
			<p>
				Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware, and Chester counties surpassed Philadelphia, but not by anything worthwhile. Each county had between 3.1 and 10 percent of mortgages exceeding $500,000, and all four counties together were the only four to even reach this range. A whopping 57 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties had less than one percent of mortgages exceeding $500,000.
			</p>
			<p>
				In total, only 11,269 households statewide had mortgages exceeding $500,000. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another staggering fact about these 11,269 households is that, racially speaking, they are 90 percent white. 
			</p>
			<div class="mid">

			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>THE NUMBERS NATIONWIDE</h4>
			<p>
				And this isn’t just a Pennsylvania problem, either. In fact, across counties, cities, and states, there is a shockingly low number of individuals whose mortgage loans exceed $500,000 – the total number of households whose loans did fell just under one million, at 989,456 total. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to NLIHC, only 5 percent of mortgages nationwide exceeded $500,000 between 2012 and 2014.
			</p>
			<div class="bottom">
				<img src="images/DSIIchartOne-02.svg"></img>
			</div>
			<p>
				Excluding the District of Columbia, Hawaii, and California, every other state in the country had less than 10 percent of mortgages exceeding $500,000 during this period. In Pennsylvania, a mere 1.5 percent of mortgages exceeded $500,000. In 18 other states, this number fell below one percent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s face it, the MID doesn’t work. All it seems to be doing is encouraging people to take on higher levels of debt in order to get larger tax breaks. Reform will benefit everyone, regardless of political beliefs or economic status, and save the country millions of dollars that can be reinvested elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time to reform the MID has come, and that time is now.
